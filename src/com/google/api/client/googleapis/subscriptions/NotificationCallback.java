 * Callback which is used to receive @{link UnparsedNotification}s after subscribing to a topic.
 *
 * <p>
 * Must not be implemented in form of an anonymous class as this will break serialization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Should be thread-safe as several notifications might be processed at the same time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * State will only be persisted once when a subscription is created. All state changes occurring
 * during the {@code .handleNotification(..)} call will be lost.

 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
