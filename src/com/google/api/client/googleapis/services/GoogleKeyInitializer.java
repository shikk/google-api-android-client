/**
 * JSON HTTP request initializer that specifies a Google API key for all requests.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is needed when doing unauthenticated access to Google APIs. Otherwise, you will only be able
 * to make a small number of queries. When you exceed this limit, you will receive a "403 Forbidden"
 * error with the message "Daily Limit Exceeded. Please sign up". See <a
 * href="http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/wiki/OAuth2#Unauthenticated_access"
 * >Unauthenticated access</a> for more details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this is not needed when doing authenticated access with OAuth 2.0, because the OAuth
 * 2.0 client ID is already associated with the same project as the API key.
